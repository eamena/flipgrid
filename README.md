## Description

I used React with Bootstrap to create this application since it's what I have been using mainly for the past 2 years. React holds on state the values submitted on the form. For the form I used formik but for validation went with my own validation than using Yup. It would have been easier to use more libraries and get it doen faster but then what would be the case of having to write some code. For the responsivness I went with bootstrap since I feel very confortable using it, Material UI its too new to me to use it for something like this. On the styling side of things I used sass, there was not much of it since there are no images or content. If needed I could have done the breakpoints myself to make it responsive. Once done if you click on the log in button it will force a refresh in the page, which will bring back the form to enroll someone else.
